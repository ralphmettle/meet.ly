I‚Äôve tried the old fashioned from signature menu, it was nice and funny. My friend kept saying it looked like Chinese soup with soils LOL. And then I‚Äôve ordered penicillin which is my favourite. It‚Äôs another good one in London. It‚Äôs smoky, fresh and gingery. It definitely surprised me.\n\nOther than that, the service was great! The waiters are very thoughtful and caring. And they served us the birthday drinks as well. I will definitely go back for the service and cocktails."

Known for its lavish interior and eye-catching purple leather chairs, Artesian is currently led by the charismatic Giulia Cuccurullo. Her team‚Äôs current menu¬†Ingredients of the Future, was a finalist for the 2023 Los Siete Misterios Best Cocktail Menu Award by the World‚Äôs 50 Best Bars.
